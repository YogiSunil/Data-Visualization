# My Answers (Sunil)

## Question 1
There are 186 countries in the dataset, and 10 countries are missing their Fragile States Index scores. These countries are Hong Kong, Kiribati, Liechtenstein, Marshall Islands, Palau, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tonga, and Vanuatu.

## Question 2
Somalia looks different from the others. It has a score of 112.3, while Yemen, which is second, only has 77.5. So there is almost a 35-point difference between them. I think this could be real because Somalia has been dealing with wars and government problems for a long time. But I am not completely sure, so I would check the original Fragile States Index website and compare the numbers with our dataset to see if there is any mistake.

## Question 3
Finland is the least fragile country with a score of 9.4. This also reminds me of our happiness assessment because Finland was one of the happiest countries there too. When I forgot to filter the missing values, countries like Hong Kong, Kiribati, and Tonga started showing up as the least fragile. This happened because JavaScript treats null like 0 when doing numerical sorting, even though those countries don't actually have a score.

## Question 4
The trend line goes upward, which means countries with higher fragility scores also tend to have higher infant mortality rates. From the trend line, it looks like for every 1-point increase in fragility, infant mortality increases by about 0.8 deaths per 1,000 births. So basically, babies in more fragile countries are at higher risk. But this doesn't mean fragility is directly causing infant deaths. It just shows that there is a relationship between them.

## Challenge 9 Prediction
"In more fragile countries, I think depression rates will be **higher**, because people living in those countries may have to deal with wars, poverty, unemployment, and unsafe living conditions. I think all these problems can affect people's mental health and increase depression."

## Question 5
My prediction was actually wrong. I thought more fragile countries would have higher depression rates, but the trend line is almost flat and goes slightly downward. Countries like Ukraine, Estonia, the United States, and Australia have some of the highest depression rates in this dataset, while countries like the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste have lower rates.

I think one reason could be that richer countries have better healthcare systems, more doctors, and more mental health research, so depression may be identified and reported more often. In poorer countries, people might also be struggling with depression, but some cases may not be identified or included in the estimates. So just because a country has a lower reported depression rate doesn't always mean people there have better mental health.


# ACS 4310 Final Assessment: What Makes a Country Miserable?

You've just been hired as a data analyst at a global aid organization. They have a limited budget and need to decide where to send help first. Your manager hands you a spreadsheet and says:

> "This file scores almost every country on earth on how badly things are going. I need to see which countries are in the most trouble — and I need to know what 'trouble' actually looks like in the numbers. Have something on screen by the end of the day."

Your dataset is `Gross Domestic Misery - World Data - World Data.csv` in this folder. Copy it into your working folder and rename it `misery.csv` to make it easier to load.

It has 186 countries and these fields:

| Field | What it means |
|:------|:--------------|
| `COUNTRY` | Country name |
| `Fragile States Index` | How close a country is to collapse. **Higher = more fragile** |
| `Women, Peace, and Security Index` | Women's inclusion, justice, and safety. 0–1, **higher = better** |
| `Poverty Rate(2010-2020)` | % of people living in poverty |
| `Infant Mortality` | Babies who die before age 1, per 1,000 births |
| `Unemployment Rate(2000-2020)` | % of workers without jobs |
| `Violent Crime Index Rate(2022)` | Violent crime rate |
| `Suicide Rate(2022)` | Suicides per 100,000 people |
| `Incarceration Rate(2022)` | Prisoners per 100,000 people |
| `Global Rate Depression(2022)` | % of people with depression |
| `Global Alcoholism rate(2019)` | % of people with alcohol use disorder |
| `Global Drug Rate(2019)` | % of people with drug use disorder |

You'll use D3, SVG, scales, and axes — the same tools from your three visualizations. Look back at your own code and the [D3 tutorial](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/d3-tutorial) as much as you like.

**Heads up:** this is real-world data, and real-world data is messy. Some cells are empty. Part of the job is noticing that.

Each challenge ends with a **Question**. Write your answers in a `README.md` next to your code — one or two sentences each is plenty. The answers matter as much as the charts.

## Grading

| Level | What you need |
|:------|:--------------|
| **Pass** | Parts 1 and 2 working (data loaded, bar chart with axes and labels) and answers to Questions 1–3 |
| **Complete** | Everything above, plus Part 3 (scatter plot, trend line, Challenge 9) and answers to Questions 4–5 |
| **Exceeds** | Everything above, plus at least one Stretch Challenge |

Work through the parts in order. A finished Part 2 is worth more than a half-finished Part 3.

## Part 1: Load and clean

### Challenge 1

Set up an HTML page with:

- A heading: "What Makes a Country Miserable?"
- Your name underneath
- Two `<svg>` elements, one for each chart you'll build
- A `<script>` tag that loads D3, and a `<script>` tag for your own code

**Run your page from a local server**, not by double-clicking the file. Browsers block `d3.csv()` from loading files when the page is opened as `file://`. Use the VS Code Live Server extension, or run `npx serve` in your project folder.

### Challenge 2

Load `misery.csv` with `d3.csv()` and log the result.

Every value comes in as a **string**, and empty cells come in as `""`. Use the row conversion function to turn the fields you need into numbers. Empty cells should become `null`, not `0` — a missing value is not the same as zero!

```JS
const num = (value) => value === '' ? null : Number(value)

const data = await d3.csv('misery.csv', d => ({
  country: d.COUNTRY,
  fragility: num(d['Fragile States Index']),
  // add the other fields you need here
}))
```

Log the data again and check that the numbers are numbers.

**Question 1:** How many countries are in the dataset? How many are missing a Fragile States Index score?

---

## Part 2: Who is in the most trouble?

### Challenge 3

Find the **10 most fragile countries**.

- Filter out countries where `fragility` is `null`
- Sort from highest to lowest `fragility`
- Keep the first 10

Log them to the console.

### Challenge 4

Draw a bar chart of those 10 countries in your first `<svg>`.

- **x scale:** `d3.scaleBand()`, domain is the country names
- **y scale:** `d3.scaleLinear()`, domain is `0` to the max fragility
- Draw one `<rect>` per country

### Challenge 5

Add axes and labels.

- A bottom axis showing country names (rotate the labels if they overlap)
- A left axis showing the fragility score
- A text label on the y axis: "Fragile States Index"

**Question 2:** Look at your chart. One country does not look like the others. Which one, and by how much? Do you think this is real, or could it be a problem with the data? How would you find out?

### Challenge 6

Now find the **10 least fragile countries** — the most stable places on earth — and log them.

Careful! Try sorting *without* filtering out the `null` values first and see what you get.

**Question 3:** Which country is the least fragile? (If you remember the happiness assessment, does this ring a bell?) What happened when you forgot to filter the empty values?

---

## Part 3: What does "trouble" look like?

A bar chart shows *who*. A scatter plot shows *why*. Each dot will be one country.

### Challenge 7

In your second `<svg>`, draw a scatter plot:

- **x:** `fragility`
- **y:** `infantMortality`
- Use `d3.scaleLinear()` for both, with `d3.extent()` or `d3.max()` for the domains
- Only plot countries that have **both** values (filter out the `null`s)
- Draw one `<circle>` per country, `r` about 4, with some transparency (`opacity: 0.6`)
- Add a bottom axis, a left axis, and a label for each

**Tip:** store the y field name in a variable (for example `const yField = 'infantMortality'`) and use `d[yField]` everywhere instead of `d.infantMortality`. You'll thank yourself in Challenge 9.

### Challenge 8

Add a **trend line** using linear regression from [lesson 14](../../lessons/lesson-14.md).

- Calculate the slope and intercept
- Use them to find the y value at the smallest and largest x
- Draw it with `d3.line()` in a color that stands out from the dots

**Question 4:** Which way does the line go? In plain English, what does that tell your manager about fragile countries and their babies?

### Challenge 9: Predict, then plot

**Before you write any code**, write down your prediction in your README:

> "In more fragile countries, I think depression rates will be **higher / lower / about the same**, because ___."

Now change your scatter plot's y value to `depression` (`Global Rate Depression(2022)`). Update the y scale, the y axis, the y label, and the trend line.

**Question 5:** Was your prediction right? Look at which countries have the *highest* depression rates. Why might the data show this? *Hint: think about what has to happen before a person gets counted as "depressed" in a dataset.*

This is the most important lesson in data visualization: **a chart shows what was measured, not always what is true.** Being able to say that out loud is what separates a data analyst from someone who makes charts.

## Stretch Challenges

Finished early? Pick any of these.

### Stretch 1: Tooltips

Add a tooltip to the scatter plot that shows the country name and both values on hover (see [lesson 15](../../lessons/lesson-15.md)). Use it to find out which country sits *furthest* from the trend line.

### Stretch 2: Pick your own y

Add a `<select>` dropdown listing every numeric field. When the user picks one, redraw the scatter plot (dots, y axis, label, trend line) against `fragility`. Use a transition so the dots slide to their new positions.

**Question:** Which field has the *strongest* relationship with fragility? Which has almost none?

### Stretch 3: Where do you live?

Highlight your own country (or one you care about) in both charts with a different color and a text label. Where does it land?

### Stretch 4: Sort it

Add a button to the bar chart that toggles between the 10 most fragile and the 10 least fragile countries, animating the bars between them.
